Because we are abstract in the type parameter `A`, we are limited in the number of possible implementations. But there's more than one implementation that meets the monoid laws.

def optionMonoid[A]: Monoid[Option[A]] = {
    def op(a1: Option[A], a2: Option[A]) = {
        a match {
            Some => Some

        }
    }

}
